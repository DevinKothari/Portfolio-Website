Devin Kothari\
Senior at CSULB, B.S. in Computer Science(est. Summer 2024)

__Description:__

The goal of this website is to have an online accessible portfolio for myself as well as a display of my knowledge and understanding of React. All of my skills and what I have learned from this endevour will be used in the creation and building of Lifelog, my senior capstone project at CSULB. Future notice; I plan to remake this website in the near future upon completion in TypeScript rather than JavaScript, link will be under __Quick Access Links__.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
